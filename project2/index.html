<! -- Brief Essay -->
<h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
<p>My first interest is walking or exercising. Recently, I've been spending a lot of time at my desk preparing for internships and jobs. Studying is not easy and it is quite stressful. However, I have found that walking or exercising is the most effective way to organize my thoughts. I love to walk and have created several courses for it. In fact, studies have shown that stimulating your feet can help you think better, so I try to take small walks at night.</p>
<p>My second favorite thing is reading. I try to read about 2-3 books a month. I also try to reread books I've already read if I enjoyed them. Honestly, it's a hobby that has become difficult to focus on nowadays with all kinds of contents pouring in, but I try to read when I have time. I still think books are the most structured and deepest source of knowledge and wisdom. I also love YouTube and other media for getting the latest current events, trends, and fragmented information quickly. </p>
<p>My third interest is YouTube. I watch a lot of different things on YouTube. Although it can be said that it is less in-depth than books, I don't think there is a medium that can keep up with YouTube in terms of what is currently the most important issue and how to effectively communicate it. There are so many different video media being produced and uploaded. I think the process is fast and varied, and the algorithm seems to know what I'm interested in, making it impossible to get away from YouTube.</p>
